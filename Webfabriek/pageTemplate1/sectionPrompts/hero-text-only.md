- **Layout**: 1-column, center-aligned text stack.
- **Max-Width**: Content block constrained to reading width (e.g., `max-w-2xl` or `max-w-3xl`), centered.

## Content Order (Top to Bottom)
1. **Eyebrow/Label**: Small, uppercase or accent color. Optional.
2. **Heading (H1)**: Large, heavy weight, centered.
3. **Intro Text**: Body paragraph, centered, constrained width for readability.

## Typography
